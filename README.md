# Package-Delivery
Python and Power BI

I considered a package delivery problem, for example how to assign packages to drivers based on locations of customers and restrictions on drivers. Then I used other data to evaluate the driver's performance affected by number of packages, weather, traveling distance, experience, safety etc. 

Finally, I created related data visulizations using Power BI. 

The datasets are from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajashrideka/package-delivery-dataset
(for package delivery assignment)
and
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pingpang/lastmiledeliverytimes
(for the second jupyter notebook "predictions")

The data for Power BI model is generated by the package assignment jupyter notebook.
