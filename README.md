# Package-Delivery
Python and Power BI

I considered a package delivery problem, for example how to assign packages to drivers based on locations of customers and restrictions on drivers. Then I used other data to evaluate the driver's performance affected by number of packages, weather, traveling distance, experience, safety etc. 

Finally, I created related data visulizations using Power BI.
